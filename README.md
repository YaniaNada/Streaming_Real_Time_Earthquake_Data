Aim: *Stream real-time Earthquake data through an API and map out vulnerable zones around the world.*

*The API request was made through Apache Kafka. All the necessary files are in the kafka-3.9.0-src folder.*

*Additionally, built a function* 'plot_earthquake_data' *to be able to zoom in at country-level and see the vulnerable zones at a local level.*
